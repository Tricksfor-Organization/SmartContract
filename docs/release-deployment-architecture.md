## 1. Trigger Model

### Primary trigger

Workflows are triggered by the `release.published` GitHub event. No deployment or publishing action runs on push, pull-request, or manual dispatch unless explicitly required for a specific maintenance scenario.

```
GitHub Release published
        │
        ▼
  release-deploy.yml
        │
        ├─► deploy-contracts job (environment-scoped)
        ├─► verify-contracts job (depends on deploy-contracts)
        └─► publish-nuget job (depends on deploy-contracts)
```

### Release pattern rules

| Tag pattern | Channel | Allowed deploy targets |
|---|---|---|
| `^v\d+\.\d+\.\d+$` (e.g. `v1.2.3`) | Stable | Any environment, including mainnet |
| `v*.*.*-rc.*` (e.g. `v1.2.3-rc.1`) | Release candidate | Testnet environments only |
| `v*.*.*-beta.*` | Beta | Testnet environments only |
| `v*.*.*-alpha.*` | Alpha | Testnet environments only |

Mainnet environments (`ethereum-mainnet`, `polygon-mainnet`, `optimism-mainnet`, `bsc-mainnet`, `avalanche-mainnet`) must only be targeted by stable releases whose tags match `^v\d+\.\d+\.\d+$`. Workflows must enforce this by requiring `github.event.release.prerelease == false` **and** validating that the tag matches the stable regex, failing fast if either condition is not met.

### Non-secret workflow selectors

The following inputs are acceptable as release-level selectors (none of these are secrets):

| Input | Source | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `target_environment` | Release title convention or tag-mapped config | Identifies which GitHub Environment to activate |
| `network_key` | Derived from `target_environment` | Short name identifying the target chain (e.g. `ethereum-mainnet`) |
| `enable_nuget_publish` | Environment variable `NUGET_PUBLISH_ENABLED` | Whether to publish the NuGet package |
| `enable_verify` | Environment variable `VERIFY_ENABLED` | Whether to run block-explorer verification |
| Version/tag | GitHub release tag | Version string used for manifests and NuGet package |

---

## 2. Versioning Model

### Source of version

The version comes exclusively from the Git tag attached to the GitHub Release. The workflow extracts the version with:

```yaml
version: ${{ github.ref_name }}            # e.g. v1.2.3 (full tag, used for Git references)
```

The `v` prefix must be stripped for NuGet SemVer. Always derive `NUGET_VERSION` via the shell substitution below — do **not** pass the raw `${{ github.ref_name }}` directly to `dotnet pack`:

```bash
NUGET_VERSION="${GITHUB_REF_NAME#v}"       # strips leading 'v' → 1.2.3
```

### Pre-release NuGet versions

Pre-release tags (e.g. `v1.2.3-rc.1`) produce NuGet package versions with the pre-release suffix intact (e.g. `1.2.3-rc.1`), which NuGet interprets as pre-release and will not install by default without opting in.

### Deployment manifest versioning

Each deployment manifest file (`deployments/{network}/{ContractName}.json`) contains the following fields, matching the current `ContractDeploymentRecord` schema:

- `contractName`: the Solidity contract name (e.g. `"TricksforBoosterNFT"`)
- `address`: the deployed contract address (checksummed hex)
- `transactionHash`: deployment transaction hash
- `blockNumber`: block number at deployment
- `deployedAt`: ISO-8601 UTC timestamp
- `constructorArgs`: constructor arguments in declaration order

> **Note:** `releaseTag` is not part of the current manifest schema. Adding it would require a code change to `ContractDeploymentRecord`, `ManifestWriter`, and related tests. If this field is adopted in the future it must be implemented as an explicit schema change — update the record, the writer, the `deployments/README.md`, and all tests together as a single atomic change.

---

## 3. Environment Model

### One GitHub Environment per deploy target

Each deployable target has a dedicated [GitHub Environment](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/targeting-different-environments). Environment names follow a strict `{chain}-{stage}` convention.

| Environment name | Chain | Stage |
|---|---|---|
| `ethereum-sepolia` | Ethereum | Testnet |
| `ethereum-mainnet` | Ethereum | Mainnet |
| `polygon-amoy` | Polygon | Testnet |
| `polygon-mainnet` | Polygon | Mainnet |
| `optimism-sepolia` | Optimism | Testnet |
| `optimism-mainnet` | Optimism | Mainnet |
| `bsc-testnet` | BNB Smart Chain | Testnet |
| `bsc-mainnet` | BNB Smart Chain | Mainnet |
| `avalanche-fuji` | Avalanche | Testnet (Fuji) |
| `avalanche-mainnet` | Avalanche | Mainnet |

### Environment protection rules

All `*-mainnet` environments must be configured with:
- **Required reviewers**: at least one named approver must approve before the workflow runs
- **Deployment branches**: restricted to the repository's default branch
- **Wait timer**: optional (recommended: 5 minutes for a review window)

Testnet environments do not require approvals and can auto-deploy.

### How the target environment is resolved

The release title or tag suffix maps to a target environment name. The mapping is maintained in a checked-in configuration file (see [Section 6](#6-deployment-parameter-model)):

```
deployments/config/{environment-name}/deployment-params.json
```

The workflow reads the `target_environment` selector from the release metadata or from a convention-based lookup. The environment name is passed directly to the `environment:` key of the GitHub Actions job.

---

## 4. Secrets Model

### Principle

**No secret value is ever passed as a release input, workflow input, or workflow variable.**

All sensitive values are stored exclusively in GitHub Environment secrets and accessed only within the job scoped to that environment.

### Secret classification

| Value | Classification | Storage location |
|---|---|---|
| Deployer wallet private key | **Secret** | GitHub Environment secret: `DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY` |
| RPC endpoint URL | **Secret** | GitHub Environment secret: `RPC_URL` |
| Block explorer API key | **Secret** | GitHub Environment secret: `EXPLORER_API_KEY` |
| NuGet API key | **Secret** | GitHub Repository secret: `NUGET_API_KEY` |
| GitHub Packages token | **Secret** | GitHub-provided: `GITHUB_TOKEN` |

### Non-secret configuration variables

| Value | Classification | Storage location |
|---|---|---|
| Chain ID | **Non-secret** | GitHub Environment variable: `CHAIN_ID` |
| Explorer base URL | **Non-secret** | GitHub Environment variable: `EXPLORER_BASE_URL` |
| Whether verification is enabled | **Non-secret** | GitHub Environment variable: `VERIFY_ENABLED` |
| Whether NuGet publish is enabled | **Non-secret** | GitHub Environment variable: `NUGET_PUBLISH_ENABLED` |
| NFT name, symbol, URIs, royalty config | **Non-secret** | Checked-in deployment params file (see Section 6) |
| Admin/minter wallet addresses | **Non-secret** | Checked-in deployment params file (see Section 6) |

### Repository-level vs. environment-level secrets

- **Environment secrets** are preferred for all chain-specific secrets. They are only available during workflow runs that target the matching environment, limiting blast radius.
- **Repository secrets** are used only for values shared across all environments (e.g. `NUGET_API_KEY`).
- Organization secrets must not be used without explicit documentation of scope and justification.

### Audit trail

Every workflow run must emit a non-secret summary log that includes:
- target environment name
- chain ID (non-secret)
- deployer address (derived from private key but not the key itself)
- contract addresses deployed

Secrets must never appear in log output. Workflows and deployment runners must not print secret values even in masked form.

This prohibition explicitly includes `RPC_URL`: the raw RPC endpoint must never be written to startup logs, step logs, exception messages, or summaries. If endpoint diagnostics are needed, log only non-secret network metadata such as the configured environment name or chain ID, not the URL itself.

> **Implementation note:** `Program.cs` currently logs `RPC URL: {config.RpcUrl}` at startup. Because `RPC_URL` is classified as a secret in this architecture, that log line must be removed before this pipeline is deployed. Log only completely non-secret metadata at startup — the configured environment name and chain ID are sufficient for diagnostics.

---

## 5. Network Model

### Supported chains

| Chain | Chain ID (mainnet) | Chain ID (testnet) | Testnet name | Explorer (mainnet) | Explorer (testnet) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Ethereum | 1 | 11155111 | Sepolia | etherscan.io | sepolia.etherscan.io |
| Polygon | 137 | 80002 | Amoy | polygonscan.com | amoy.polygonscan.com |
| Optimism | 10 | 11155420 | OP Sepolia | optimistic.etherscan.io | sepolia-optimism.etherscan.io |
| BNB Smart Chain | 56 | 97 | BSC Testnet | bscscan.com | testnet.bscscan.com |
| Avalanche | 43114 | 43113 | Fuji | snowtrace.io | testnet.snowtrace.io |

### Chain-specific value resolution

Chain-specific secrets and variables are resolved entirely through the GitHub Environment mapped to the deploy target. The workflow does not contain any hardcoded chain parameters. Chain configuration flows through the following path:

```
GitHub Environment secrets/variables
        │
        ▼
  Workflow job (environment: <name>)
        │
        ▼
  Deployment runner (env vars: RPC_URL, CHAIN_ID, DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY)
```

The deployment runner (`src/Tricksfor.Blockchain.Booster.Deploy`) reads all chain-specific values from environment variables using the `Deployment__*` prefix convention already implemented in `Program.cs`:

- `Deployment__RpcUrl` → from `RPC_URL` environment secret
- `Deployment__ChainId` → from `CHAIN_ID` environment variable
- `Deployment__PrivateKey` → from `DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY` environment secret
- `DEPLOY_ENV` → set to the **full `{chain}-{stage}` environment name** (e.g. `polygon-mainnet`)
- `Deployment__Network` → can be set separately if the manifest folder name should differ from `DEPLOY_ENV`; defaults to the value of `DEPLOY_ENV`

> **Manifest folder naming:** In a multi-chain pipeline, using the full `{chain}-{stage}` name as `Deployment__Network` is the recommended approach. This avoids the ambiguity of short names (e.g., plain `mainnet` is not unique across Ethereum, Polygon, and BNB Smart Chain). The existing `deployments/README.md` shows short names (`sepolia`, `mainnet`) from the single-chain era; the multi-chain convention extends this to `ethereum-mainnet`, `polygon-amoy`, etc. When running the pipeline, `Deployment__Network` should be set explicitly to the `{chain}-{stage}` key so manifests are written to unambiguous paths (e.g. `deployments/polygon-mainnet/`).

### Adding a new chain

To add a new supported chain:
1. Create a GitHub Environment named `{chain}-{stage}` and populate its secrets and variables.
2. Add an entry to the network table in this document.
3. Add a corresponding `deployments/config/{environment-name}/deployment-params.json` file.
4. Add the explorer verification configuration for the new chain in the Hardhat config.

No workflow file changes are required if the deployment runner and environment strategy are followed.

---

## 6. Deployment Parameter Model

### Strategy: checked-in parameter files + environment secrets

Deployment parameters are split into two categories:

| Category | Examples | Where stored |
|---|---|---|
| **Non-secret constructor args** | NFT name, symbol, base URI, contract URI, royalty receiver address, royalty basis points | Checked-in JSON file per environment |
| **Admin / role addresses** | Admin wallet, minter wallet, pauser wallet | Checked-in JSON file per environment |
| **Secrets** | Private key, RPC URL, explorer API key | GitHub Environment secrets (never committed) |

### Parameter file location and format

```
deployments/config/
├── ethereum-sepolia/
│   └── deployment-params.json
├── ethereum-mainnet/
│   └── deployment-params.json
├── polygon-amoy/
│   └── deployment-params.json
├── polygon-mainnet/
│   └── deployment-params.json
├── optimism-sepolia/
│   └── deployment-params.json
├── optimism-mainnet/
│   └── deployment-params.json
├── bsc-testnet/
│   └── deployment-params.json
├── bsc-mainnet/
│   └── deployment-params.json
├── avalanche-fuji/
│   └── deployment-params.json
└── avalanche-mainnet/
    └── deployment-params.json
```

### Parameter file schema

```json
{
  "Deployment": {
    "Network": "ethereum-mainnet",
    "ChainId": 1,
    "DeploymentsOutputPath": "deployments",
    "Nft": {
      "Name": "TricksforBooster",
      "Symbol": "TFB",
      "BaseUri": "https://meta.tricksfor.gg/booster/",
      "ContractMetadataUri": "https://meta.tricksfor.gg/booster/contract.json",
      "RoyaltyReceiver": "0xYOUR_ROYALTY_RECEIVER_ADDRESS",
      "RoyaltyFeeBasisPoints": 500
    }
  }
}
```

`RoyaltyReceiver` may be left empty (`""`) if the deployer address should be used; `DeploymentRunner` already handles this default.

### Workflow integration

The deployment runner loads `appsettings.{DEPLOY_ENV}.json` from `AppContext.BaseDirectory` (the published binary output directory), not from the repository source tree. The `.csproj` currently only copies `appsettings.json` and `appsettings.localhost.json` to the output directory automatically.

To make the per-environment params file available at runtime, the workflow must:
1. Publish the runner to an explicit output directory.
2. Copy the params file into that same output directory under the expected filename.
3. Run the published binary from that directory.

```yaml
- name: Publish deployment runner
  run: dotnet publish src/Tricksfor.Blockchain.Booster.Deploy \
          --configuration Release \
          --output ./runner-output

- name: Copy deployment params
  run: cp deployments/config/${{ env.DEPLOY_ENV }}/deployment-params.json \
          runner-output/appsettings.${{ env.DEPLOY_ENV }}.json

- name: Run deployment
  run: dotnet runner-output/Tricksfor.Blockchain.Booster.Deploy.dll
  env:
    DEPLOY_ENV: ${{ env.DEPLOY_ENV }}
    Deployment__RpcUrl: ${{ secrets.RPC_URL }}
    Deployment__PrivateKey: ${{ secrets.DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY }}
    Deployment__ChainId: ${{ vars.CHAIN_ID }}
    Deployment__Network: ${{ env.DEPLOY_ENV }}
```

Secrets are injected via environment variables and take highest priority over any appsettings value. The `deployment-params.json` only needs to supply non-secret constructor arguments (`Nft.Name`, `Nft.Symbol`, `Nft.BaseUri`, etc.) that are not overridden by env vars.

---

## 7. Verification Model

### When verification runs

Verification runs as a separate job that depends on the `deploy-contracts` job. It can be skipped per environment by setting `VERIFY_ENABLED=false` in the GitHub Environment variables. Verification is always skipped when deploying to `localhost` or any environment with `VERIFY_ENABLED` unset or set to `false`.

### Tooling

Contract verification uses [Hardhat Verify](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/plugins/nomicfoundation-hardhat-verify) (via `@nomicfoundation/hardhat-verify`), which supports all five target chains through their Etherscan-compatible API endpoints.

### Compiler artifact preservation

The `artifacts/` directory (containing compiled contract JSON with ABI, bytecode, and compiler metadata) must be committed to the repository and used as-is during verification. The workflow must not recompile contracts during verification — it must use the same artifact that was used during deployment.

Constructor arguments must be captured from the deployment manifest produced by step 4 of the deployment flow and passed to the verification command. The `ManifestWriter` already records `constructorArgs` in the manifest JSON.

### Verification flow

```
deploy-contracts job completes
        │
        ▼
verify-contracts job starts
        ├── npm ci (restore node_modules)
        ├── Use committed artifacts/ exactly as produced for deployment
        ├── Do not run: npx hardhat compile
        ├── Read contract addresses from deployment manifests
        ├── Read constructor args from deployment manifests
        ├── Run: npx hardhat verify --no-compile --network {NETWORK_KEY} {NFT_ADDRESS} {NFT_ARGS...}
        └── Run: npx hardhat verify --no-compile --network {NETWORK_KEY} {STAKING_ADDRESS} {STAKING_ARGS...}
```

### Explorer endpoints per chain

| Environment | Hardhat network name | Explorer API base URL |
|---|---|---|
| `ethereum-sepolia` | `sepolia` | `https://api-sepolia.etherscan.io/api` |
| `ethereum-mainnet` | `mainnet` | `https://api.etherscan.io/api` |
| `polygon-amoy` | `polygon_amoy` | `https://api-amoy.polygonscan.com/api` |
| `polygon-mainnet` | `polygon` | `https://api.polygonscan.com/api` |
| `optimism-sepolia` | `optimism_sepolia` | `https://api-sepolia-optimism.etherscan.io/api` |
| `optimism-mainnet` | `optimism` | `https://api-optimistic.etherscan.io/api` |
| `bsc-testnet` | `bsc_testnet` | `https://api-testnet.bscscan.com/api` |
| `bsc-mainnet` | `bsc` | `https://api.bscscan.com/api` |
| `avalanche-fuji` | `avalanche_fuji` | `https://api-testnet.snowtrace.io/api` |
| `avalanche-mainnet` | `avalanche` | `https://api.snowtrace.io/api` |

`EXPLORER_API_KEY` is intended to be provided from the GitHub Environment secret and exposed to Hardhat verification via `ETHERSCAN_API_KEY` (which the Hardhat Verify plugin reads by default for all Etherscan-compatible explorers).

> **Implementation note:** the network names and explorer endpoints above are the target mapping for the release pipeline, but they are **not yet configured** in `hardhat.config.ts`. A required follow-up change is to add the corresponding `networks` entries and the `etherscan` / `verify` configuration block to `hardhat.config.ts` so that `npx hardhat verify --no-compile --network {NETWORK_KEY}` actually works for each of these chains. Until that change is in place, verification will fail for any network other than `localhost`.

### What must be preserved for verification

- Solidity compiler version (`0.8.26`)
- EVM target (`cancun`)
- Optimizer settings (must match `hardhat.config.ts`)
- Compiled `artifacts/` directory (committed to repository)
- Constructor arguments (from deployment manifest)

---

## 8. NuGet Publishing Model

### Package identity

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| Package ID | `Tricksfor.SmartContracts` |
| Project | `src/Tricksfor.Blockchain.Booster/Tricksfor.Blockchain.Booster.csproj` |
| Target framework | `net8.0` |
| Package source | nuget.org (primary) and/or GitHub Packages |

See [docs/nuget-packaging.md](./nuget-packaging.md) for the full versioning strategy,
pre-release suffix rules, and breaking-change guidance.

### What is included in the package

| Included | Description |
|---|---|
| Nethereum event DTOs | C# classes matching all `TokenStaked`, `TokenUnstaked`, `EmergencyWithdrawn` event signatures |
| Nethereum function message types | C# classes for all public contract functions |
| Deployment messages | `TricksforBoosterNFTDeployment`, `TricksforBoosterStakingDeployment` |
| Contract service wrappers | `BoosterStakingService`, `BoosterNFTService` |
| Embedded ABI + bytecode | `TricksforBoosterNFTAbi`, `TricksforBoosterStakingAbi` |

The package does **not** include:
- Deployment runner (`Tricksfor.Blockchain.Booster.Deploy`)
- Deployment manifests
- Private keys, RPC URLs, or any secrets

### Versioning

The NuGet package version is derived from the Git tag of the triggering release, with the leading `v` stripped:

| Git tag | NuGet version |
|---|---|
| `v1.2.3` | `1.2.3` |
| `v1.2.3-rc.1` | `1.2.3-rc.1` |
| `v1.2.3-beta.2` | `1.2.3-beta.2` |

The workflow injects the version at pack time:

```bash
dotnet pack src/Tricksfor.Blockchain.Booster/Tricksfor.Blockchain.Booster.csproj \
  --configuration Release \
  --output ./nupkg \
  /p:PackageVersion="${GITHUB_REF_NAME#v}"
```

### Publishing targets

**Primary target: nuget.org**

```bash
dotnet nuget push ./nupkg/*.nupkg \
  --api-key ${{ secrets.NUGET_API_KEY }} \
  --source https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json
```

`NUGET_API_KEY` is a repository-level secret (not environment-scoped, as the same package serves all chains).

**Secondary target: GitHub Packages (optional)**

GitHub Packages may be used as a fallback or for pre-release packages. The `GITHUB_TOKEN` provided automatically by Actions is sufficient for publishing to GitHub Packages.

### Trusted Publishing

When nuget.org supports OIDC Trusted Publishing for GitHub Actions, this workflow should migrate to Trusted Publishing to eliminate the long-lived `NUGET_API_KEY` secret. The migration is a forward-compatible change and does not affect consumers.

### Publish gate

NuGet publishing is controlled by the `NUGET_PUBLISH_ENABLED` environment variable stored per-environment in GitHub Environment variables. This allows test environments to run the full pipeline without publishing a package.

The `publish-nuget` job additionally checks:

1. The `NUGET_PUBLISH_ENABLED` variable is `true`.
2. The triggering release is not a GitHub draft release.
3. The triggering release tag matches the stable pattern (`^v\d+\.\d+\.\d+$`) when publishing to nuget.org.
   - Pre-release packages may be published to GitHub Packages but not to nuget.org unless explicitly enabled.

---

## 9. Failure Handling Model

### Job dependency graph

```
test
 └── deploy-contracts
       ├── verify-contracts
       └── publish-nuget
```

All jobs are separate and independently retryable. `verify-contracts` and `publish-nuget` are set to `needs: [deploy-contracts]` but are independent of each other (`verify-contracts` does not block `publish-nuget`).

### Deployment succeeds, verification fails

Verification failure does **not** roll back the deployment. Contracts deployed on EVM chains cannot be undeployed. The workflow:

1. Marks the `verify-contracts` job as failed.
2. Uploads the deployment manifest as a workflow artifact so addresses are recoverable.
3. Allows the operator to re-run only the `verify-contracts` job manually once the issue is resolved (e.g. missing API key, explorer outage).

### Deployment succeeds, NuGet publish fails

NuGet publish failure does **not** roll back the deployment. The workflow:

1. Marks the `publish-nuget` job as failed.
2. Uploads the `.nupkg` file as a workflow artifact so the package can be pushed manually.
3. Allows the operator to re-run only the `publish-nuget` job manually.

### Deployment fails

If `deploy-contracts` fails, all dependent jobs (`verify-contracts`, `publish-nuget`) are automatically skipped. The workflow:

1. Marks the `deploy-contracts` job as failed.
2. Retains any partial output artifacts (e.g. partially written manifests, transaction hashes) as workflow artifacts for post-mortem analysis.

### Artifacts retained on every run

Regardless of job outcome, the following artifacts are always uploaded:

| Artifact | Job | Retention |
|---|---|---|
| Deployment manifests (`deployments/{network}/*.json`) | `deploy-contracts` | 90 days |
| NuGet package (`.nupkg`) | `publish-nuget` | 90 days |
| Verification transcript (stdout/stderr of verify commands) | `verify-contracts` | 30 days |

### Manual retry guidance

| Scenario | Action |
|---|---|
| Re-run verification after API key fix | Re-run `verify-contracts` job in the failed workflow run |
| Re-run NuGet publish after auth fix | Re-run `publish-nuget` job in the failed workflow run, or push the retained `.nupkg` artifact manually via `dotnet nuget push` |
| Re-deploy after RPC failure | Create a new release or trigger a manual deploy workflow if defined |
| Explorer outage during verification | Wait for explorer recovery, then re-run `verify-contracts` job |

---

## Summary: Decision Table

| Concern | Decision |
|---|---|
| Workflow trigger | `release.published` event only |
| Pre-release → mainnet | **Blocked** (enforced in workflow) |
| Stable → testnet | Allowed |
| Secret injection | GitHub Environment secrets only |
| Non-secret config | Checked-in `deployment-params.json` per environment |
| Chain selection | One GitHub Environment per chain/stage |
| Mainnet approval | Required reviewers on all `*-mainnet` environments |
| Contract verification | Hardhat Verify, separate job, skippable per environment |
| NuGet package ID | `Tricksfor.Blockchain.Nethereum` |
| NuGet version source | Git tag (strip leading `v`) |
| NuGet publish target | nuget.org (primary), GitHub Packages (optional) |
| Verification failure | Non-blocking, artifact retained, job retryable |
| NuGet publish failure | Non-blocking, `.nupkg` retained, job retryable |
| Deployment failure | Blocks dependent jobs, artifacts retained |
